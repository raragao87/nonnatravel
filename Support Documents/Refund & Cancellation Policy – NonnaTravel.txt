Refund & Cancellation Policy – NonnaTravel
Effective Date: [Insert Date]
NonnaTravel strives to provide flexibility while ensuring fair compensation for the local guides, drivers, restaurants, and partners who prepare your experience in advance.
This policy reflects the booking conditions agreed upon at purchase.
________________


1. Cancellation by the Traveler
Cancellations made 3 months or more before the scheduled experience
You will receive a full refund of the amount paid.
Cancellations made less than 3 months before the experience
Because local partners are already confirmed and costs have been incurred, no refund can be issued.
________________


2. Rescheduling Policy
You may reschedule your experience once, free of charge, if the request is made:
* at least 1 month before your scheduled date.

Rescheduling requests made less than 1 month before the experience cannot be accommodated, as local services have already been secured.
A rescheduled experience cannot be refunded later.
________________


3. Changes to Group Size
You may add additional travelers at any time, subject to availability.
Removing travelers does not entitle you to a partial refund once within the non-refundable window.
________________


4. Add-ons (Cooking, Wine Tasting, Festival, Certificate, Photo/Video)
Add-ons may be canceled for a full refund up to 3 months before the experience date.
Add-ons are non-refundable after this deadline.
Some add-ons depend on local availability; if NonnaTravel cannot honor an add-on you selected, you will receive a full refund for that add-on.
________________


5. No-Shows
Failure to appear at the designated meeting location or at the confirmed start time will be treated as a non-refundable cancellation.
________________


6. Cancellation by NonnaTravel
NonnaTravel may need to cancel an experience due to:
   * Severe weather

   * Safety issues

   * Local partner unavailability

   * Transportation disruptions

   * Force majeure events

If NonnaTravel cancels your experience, you may choose between:
      * A full refund, or

      * A new date at no additional cost

NonnaTravel is not responsible for additional expenses you may incur (e.g., flights, hotels, rental cars).
________________


7. Force Majeure
If circumstances beyond our control prevent delivery of the experience, including natural disasters, political unrest, public health emergencies, or strikes, NonnaTravel will work to reschedule your experience.
If rescheduling is not possible, a partial or full refund may be offered depending on costs already incurred with local partners.
